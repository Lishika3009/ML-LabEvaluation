## Summary
This project compared various regression models to predict a continuous target variable. Linear models (Bayesian Ridge, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression) consistently outperformed more complex models like tree-based and regularization methods. Further research could involve hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to potentially improve performance.
